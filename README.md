# Blog Aggregation

![Blog Aggregator](.images/1.png "Blog Aggregator")

## Introduction

It's a web server that allows clients to:

- Add RSS feeds to be collected
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow
- RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content.

You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

## Steps

I published each step of my design process in Medium, and it'll be helpful to follow along the details of this project with the articles if you want to learn to scrape:
