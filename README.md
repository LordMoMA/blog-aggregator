# Blog Aggregation

## Introduction

It's a web server that allows clients to:

- Add RSS feeds to be collected
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow
- RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content.

You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!
